<h3><b>Textures of Metamorphic rocks:</b></h3><br>
1. <b>Platy or elongated</b> minerals align themselves parallel to the axis of pressure, resulting in a layered appearance or foliation. <br>
Minerals differ in foliation based on their composition:<br>

<ul>
<li> <i>If the minerals are microscopic, the rock may not appear foliated to the naked eye.</i> The foliation, however, will manifest itself physically in the rock's tendency to separate along parallel planes. This type of texture is called slaty.

<li> <i>If the minerals are barely visible to the naked eye, their alignment results in an obvious but not very weil-defined foliation.</i> This type of texture is called phyllitic.

<li> <i> If the minerals are visible to the naked eye, their layering is more distinct and results in a texture called schistose.</i> These types of rocks are usuallycomposed of platy minerals like chlorite, graphite, biotite, and muscovite.

<li> <i>If the minerals are visible and elongated, the rock exhibits a coarsely branded appearance due to che alignment of minerals like amphibole, feldspar, and quartz.</i> This type of texture is called gneissic.

</ul>



2. <b>Crystalline textures</b> result when the parent rock is exposed with enough heat that it induces <i>recrystailization of the existing minerals. </i><i>Crystalline metamorphic rocks</i> are usually composed only of one type of mineral it will metamorphose into marble. But when conglomerate rocks which is composed of rock and mineral fragments undergo contact metamorphism, the smaller components may recrystallize, producing a metaconglomerate â€” a rock that physically resembles the parent material but is more dense and shows evidence of deformation.

<h3><b> Mineral compostion of metamorphic rocks: </b></h3><br>

Metamorphic rocks are mostly composed of minerals that only form at the high ternperature and pressures associated with the process of metamorphism. These minerals are known as <i>index minerals</i>. They aid in the identification of metamorphic rocks as well as the temperature and pressure when it was formed. It includes sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and some garnet. However, igneous minerals may also be found in metamorphic rocks, as long as the pressure and temperature allow them to be stable. Otherwise, they will transform into a more stable metamorphic mineral.<br><br>

<i>Metamorphic rocks</i> form when preexisting or parent rocks (whether igneous, sedimentary, or even metamorphic) are altered by heat, pressure, and the chemical activity of fluids. These processes are collectively called <i>metamorphism.</i><br><br>


<h3><b>There are two major types of metamorphism depending on which factor causes the alterat:ion of the parent rock:</h3></b><br>

1. When the dominant altering factor is <i>pressure,</i> usually due to tectonic activity, the flat and/or elongated mineral components of the preexisting rocks react by aligning perpendicular to the axis of the pressure. This result in a layered or banded appearance in the rocks called faliatioz, and these types of rocks are called foliated meramorphic rocks. This type of metamorphism is called regioal metamorphism, as tectonic processes involved in this process are regional in scale that produces mountain chains. Examples of these include slate, schist, and gneiss.<br><br>

2. When the dominant altering factor is <i>heat,</i> usually from direct contact between an older rock material and an intruding body of magma, the parent rocks may undergo a fundamental change in texture due to recrystallization, or even change in mineralogy when chemically-active fuids
are also involved.- This process is called contact metamorphism . It results in rocks like marble and
quartzite that are called zoafotiated netamorpbic rocks 

Although heat and pressure are still the dominant for the change in form, <i>metamorphism</i> may immediately happen from instantaneous events such as faulting for dynamic metamorphism and meteorite impact for shock metamorphism.<br>
