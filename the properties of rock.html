<h3>Physical properties of rocks:</h3>
<ul>

<li> <b>Color</b><br>- Color is the most noticeable property of minerals and is also an identifying feature. For example, sulfur can be easily identified by its <i>yellow color</i>. The color of a mineral depends on its chemical composition. The color is caused by the absorption or lack of absorption of various wavelengths of light. However, color association is not a reliable technique in identifying many minerals. Quartz may be clear, lavender, purple, brown, yellow, or pink, depending on the impurities found in its structure. Iron can also produce the red color associated with limonite.

<li> <b>Streak</b><br>
- Streak is the color left by a pulverized mineral on a plate. A streak test may also be used in identifying minerals. This involves rubbing the miner across an unglazed porcelain tile or streak plate. The mineral will leave a colored streak, mark, or line of powder on the tile. The same mineral will always leave the same color no matter what color the mineral appears to the eve. This is the reason why streak is more reliable property in identifying minerals than color. A mineral's streak may be different from the mineral's original color. Quartz will always create a white streak whether it looks violet (amethyst), brown, (smoky quartz), or pink (rose quartz). Also, since the streak plate has a hardness of 7, minerals with a hardness greater than 7 will not leave a mark.


<li><b>Luster</b> <br>- Luster is the quality of light reflected off minerals. Luster can be described as <i>metallic, greasy, dull, Vitreous, and silky.</i> <i>Metallic luster</i> is used to describe an opaque mineral with a shiny appearance. An an example of a mineral that has a metallic luster is pyrite. <i>Greasy luster</i> is the quality of light that strike minerals which are coated with grease. <i>Dull luster</i> is  exhibited by minerals which are porous, hence have a poor reflective surface. <i>Vitreous luster</i> is described as glassy and is often exhibited by transparent or translucent minerals. <i>Silky luster</i> is shown by minerals that are composed of parallel fibers.

<li><b> Hardness</b><br> - Hardness is a measure of strength of the mineral's chemical bonds. It should not be mistaken for brittleness, which is purely related.to the structure of the mineral. Minerals with, tightly-packed small atoms. tend to be the hardest minerals. The hardness of A mineral is important in the gem industry. Very few soft minerals are cut as gems. Those that are used for jewelry has a hardness of 7 or greater. The hardness of the mineral also determines its use. Hard minerals are used for polishing, grinding, and abrasive purposes while soft ones are used as pencil lead, talcum powder,and paper gloss.

<li><b>Density</b><br> - The density of a mineral is basically, the ratio of its mass to volume. Generally, nonmetallic minerals have lower density than metallic minerals. try to imagine yourself holding a styrofoam ball and a metal ball that are the same size. The metal ball has much more than the Styrofoam ball. It feels heavier and has a greater density because its molecules are more tightly packed.

<li><b>Cleavage</b><br>
- A  hammer may be used to break a mineral apart, Minerals break along planes of weakness due to their crystalline structure. These breaks are called cleavages. Some may break in one direction, others in two or more. When a mineral break into splinters or irregular surfaces, then it shows fracture; but it it breaks along regular surfaces, then it shows cleavage.
