<h1><font color=Brown>The Rock Cycle</font></h1>
The <i>rock cycle</i> is a continuous process that describes the transformation of rocks from one type to another over vast stretches of geological time. It's a never-ending loop where each rock type can eventually become any other type under the influence of various geological forces. <br>

<h3><b> Formation of rocks </b></h3>

<b>Igneous Rocks:</b> Formed when molten rock (magma) cools and solidifies. This can happen below the surface (intrusive) or above the surface (extrusive through volcanic eruptions.<br>
<b>Weathering and Erosion:</b> Igneous rocks are exposed to weathering and erosion, breaking down into smaller fragments called sediments (sand, gravel,clay).<br>
<b>Metamorphism:</b> As sedimentary rocks get buried deeper or subjected to high pressure and temperature due to tectonic activity, they undergo metamorphism.This alters the mineral composition and texture of     the rock.<br>      
<b>Melting:</b> Under extreme heat and pressure (e.g., near tectonic plate boundaries), metamorphic rocks can melt again, transforming back into magma.
    The rock cycle is a dynamic system, and these stages can happen over millions or even billions of years. It's a beautiful illustration of how Earth's geology is constantly evolving.<br>
