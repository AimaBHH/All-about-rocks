<i>Sedimentary rocks</i> are formed from the accumulation and lithification (compaction and cementation) of sediments. These sediments can come from various sources,       leading to different types of sedimentary rocks.<br><br>

Sedimentary rocks are <i>clastic</i> when they form from the lithification of rocks and mineral fragments such I
as quartz, feldspar, and clay. Sedimentary rocks are <i>crystalline</i> when they precipitate out of solution
which forms dolomite, calcite, halite or gypsum. Sedimentary rocks can also be <i>bioclastic</i> when it forms
as the result of the accumulation of organic material or biological activity. It may even contain remnants
of plants, corals, shell, or fossil fragments.<br><br>

<i>Sedimentary clastic texture</i> may further may refined whether shapes of the individual grains are angular
or rounded.<br> <i>Clasts</i> may also be described based on their sizes and is divided into three types: 
<ul>
<li>clay or silt (1/16 mm)
<li>Sand (1/16 and 2 mm)
<li> Gravel (greater than 2 mm).
</ul>
